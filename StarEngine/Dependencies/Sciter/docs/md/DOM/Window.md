# class Window

Instances of the Window class represent desktop windows.

`Window.this` is a reference to current window object, that is the instance of the `Window` class where the HTML document is loaded.

NOTE: the _window_ below is an instance of Sciter's Window class - e.g. `Window.this` but not that strange "window" thing of browsers. 

## constructor:

```js 
new Window({params:object})
```

where `params` is an object with properties:

+ `type` - optional, is one of:
  
  + `Window.POPUP_WINDOW`
  + `Window.TOOL_WINDOW`
  + `Window.CHILD_WINDOW`
  + `Window.FRAME_WINDOW` - default window type
  + `Window.DIALOG_WINDOW`

+ `parent` : Window - optional, instance of parent (owner window). When owner is closed or minimized then this window will be closed/minimized too. _parent_ defines z-order of this new window. Window with the defined _parent_ will always float on top its parent.
+ `caption` : string - optional, window caption (or title).
+ `x` : integer - optional, screen pixels, horizontal position of the window on screen;
+ `y` : integer - optional, screen pixels, vertical position of the window from the top of the screen;
+ `width` : integer - screen pixels, window width;
+ `height` : integer - screen pixels, window height;
+ `client` : true | false - if `true` then x,y,w,h are coordinates of desired window client box on the screen;
+ `alignment` : integer - optional, \[1 to 9\] alignment of the window on monitor, if \[-1 to -9\] and parent is provided then it aligns the window against parent window. (1 bottom left corner, 2 bottom middle, 3 bottom right corner, 4 middle left, 5 center, 6 middle right, 7 top left corner, 8 top middle, 9 top right corner)
+ `screen` : integer - optional, number of monitor on multi-home systems.
+ `state` : - optional - window state, is one of:

  + `Window.WINDOW_SHOWN` - default state
  + `Window.WINDOW_MINIMIZED`
  + `Window.WINDOW_MAXIMIZED`
  + `Window.WINDOW_HIDDEN`
  + `Window.WINDOW_FULL_SCREEN`

+ `url` : string - optional, window html source code file.
+ `parameters` : array | string | object, ... - optional, extra parameters to pass to the new window.

---

### addHotKeyHandler()

```js
window.addHotKeyHandler(keyCombination:string, callback:function):id
```
  
Registers global system hotkey hook. hotkey handlers allows to handle key combinations when the window is not in focus or even hidden.

The function throws an error if the system rejects the hotkey, for example if that hotkey is already assigned to other application.

_keyCombination_ is a `+`  combination of optional modifiers and key name (event.code names) like: `"F5"` and `"Control+KeyN"`. Supported modifiers:

+  `Control` or `Ctrl`; 
+  `Command` or `Cmd` - CMD key on MacOS and Win key on Windows;
+  `Alt`;
+  `AltGr`;
+  `Shortcut` - is CMD key on MacOS and Ctrl on other OSes;
+  `Shift`;
  
The function returns an id that can be used to unregister hot key.

:::warning
this function is supported only on Windows for a while as only this OS has official hotkey API.
:::


### removeHotKeyHandler()
   
```js
removeHotKeyHandler(id)
```

Window.this
```

property, instance of Window class - reference of the window where this code is running;

### all

```js
for(let wnd of Window.all)
   ...
```

### share

```js
Window.share: Object
```

property, is an object shared between all documents and windows in the application.

:::warning
Use it responsibly. If temporary window or document populates shared object then it should clean the stuff there in _beforeunload_.
:::    

---

### screens

```js
Window.screens: integer
```

returns number of screens (monitors) in the system;

### screenBox() {#nth-screenBox}

```js
Window.screenBox(screen:integer, what[, boxPart])
```

reports geometry and information of the given _screen_ (monitor). For _what_ and _boxPart_ parameters see [window.screenBox()](#screenbox) method above.

Additionally _what_ supports "devicePixelRatio" value, in this case the function returns the ratio of the resolution in physical pixels to the resolution in CSS pixels for the given monitor.

---

### elementAt()

```js
Window.elementAt(screenX,screenY):Element
```
  
returns DOM element under screenX/screenY position. 

:::note
This method may return DOM element belonging to any Sciter window in current process. 
:::

---

### ticks()

```js
Window.ticks():milliseconds
```

returns value of internal timer in milliseconds.

### post() {#Window-post}

```js
Window.post( ge: Event )
```

posts global event *ge* to all windows in current process.

### send() {#Window-send}

```js
Window.send( ge: Event ) : boolean
```

Synchronously sends global event *ge* to all windows in current process.

Sending stops on first window that will consume the event by returning _true_ from event handler of this event.

Returns _true_ if some event handler consumes the event.

## events

Use `window.on("eventname", handler)` to subscribe to these events.

### "statechange"

`window.state` flag has changed.

### "closerequest"

Window closure requested.

JS code can prevent window closure by the user by calling `event.preventDefault()`: 
```js
const CLOSE_BY_CHROME = 0; // user clicked `🗙` on window chrome
const CLOSE_BY_CODE = 1;   // window.close() issued
const CLOSE_BY_LOAD = 2;   // document unload-old/load-new

Window.this.on("closerequest", event => {
  if(event.reason == CLOSE_BY_CHROME) {
    // instead of closing we just minimize it:
    Window.this.state = Window.WINDOW_MINIMIZED;
    event.preventDefault(); // prevent closing the window
  }
});
```

### "resolutionchange"

after window moved to another monitor with different resolution, or user have changed screen resolution.

### "mediachange"

one or several CSS media variables have changed.

### "activate"

the window was deactivated (evt.reason == 0) or got focus (evt.reason > 0).

### "replacementstart"
### "replacementend"

the user has started/ended moving or resizing window frame.

### "move"

user have moved the window.

### "size"

user have changed size of the window.

### "trayiconclick"

the user has clicked on tray icon.

### "spacechange"

Space (a.k.a. virtual desktop) has changed. Use `Window.this.isOnActiveSpace` property to determine if window is on active space now.
