# class Element

Class Element represents DOM element and extends [Node](../Node) and so all its methods are available on element.

## Properties:

### id

string, ID of the element.

### name

string, value of attribute "name" of the element.

### tagName

string, read-only, tag of the element in upper case: "DIV", "SPAN"

### tag

string, read-only, tag of the element in lower case: "div", "span"

:::note  
Sciter specific
:::

### className

string, value of attribute "class" of the element.

### elementIndex

integer, read-only, index of this element in its parent child elements. 

:::note  
Sciter specific. Can be different from nodeIndex. 
:::

### innerHTML

string, gets or sets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element.

### outerHTML

string, gets or sets outer HTML or XML markup of the element. Setting outerHTML of the element effectively replaces it by the new element. 

### innerText

string, on gets it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard. As a setter this will replace the element's children with the given value. 

### value

Can report JS value of any type. Type of the value is determined by [native behavior](../../behaviors) attached to the element. 

Returns _undefined_ if the element has no behaviors attached.

---

### firstElementChild
### lastElementChild
### nextElementSibling
### previousElementSibling

read-only, these properties report corresponding neighbour or child elements of the element. 

### childElementCount

integer, read-only, reports number of immediate child elements contained in this one. 

---
### offsetLeft, offsetTop, offsetWidth, offsetHeight

pixels, read-only. For block-level elements, offsetTop, offsetLeft, offsetWidth, and offsetHeight describe the border box of an element relative to the offsetParent.

### offsetParent

Element, readonly, a reference to the element which is the closest (nearest in the containment hierarchy) positioned ancestor element.

---

### clientLeft, clientTop

pixels, read-only, distance of element's border to the origin of scrolling area clip rectangle. Essentially that is padding box minus area taken by scrollbars.

### clientWidth, clientHeight

pixels, read-only, dimensions of scrolling area clip rectangle (padding box minus area taken by scrollbars).

---

### scrollLeft, scrollTop

pixels, scroll position of element's content. 

### scrollPosition

[Point](../../Graphics/Point), scroll position of element's content as a Point. 

### scrollWidth, scrollHeight

pixels, width and height of scrollable content of the element.

### readonly

boolean, on get returns true if element or one of its parents is readonly, on set declares the element and all its descendants as readonly. In CSS this state is reflected as `:readonly`.

### checked

boolean, gets/sets `:checked` state flag in CSS.

### src

string, applicable to elements that support `src` attribute (`<img>` for example).

### postEvent()

invokes event handlers asynchronously on the element. The function enqueues the event into message queue and returns immediately.

:::tip
sciter specific, asynchronous version of .dispatchEvent()
:::


---

## Methods (Sciter specific):


### on()

```js
element.on(eventname: string, [selector: string,] handler: function): Element
```

jQuery style event subscription, parameters:

- *eventname* - string, name of event that 
  + may start with `^` for handling events in capturing phase;
  * may contain namespace part: `"click.myns"`;
- *selector* - string, optional, CSS selector of target element; 
- *handler* - function(evt,target), event handling function that:
  + is called with `this` set to element the element this handler is attached to;
  + is called with two parameters `handler(evt,matchedElement)` - event and the element matching the *selector* if it was given;

returns:
- the element itself allowing to chain `on` calls;


### off()

```js
 element.off(eventname): Element
```
Unsubscribe event handlers either by name  `"click"` or by namespace `".myns"`.

```js
 element.off(handler: function): Element
```
Unsubscribe event handlers by function reference.

### once()

```js
element.once(eventname: string, [selector: string,] handler: function): Element
```
Same as `element.on()` but calls `element.off(handler)` after handling the event once.

---

### onGlobalEvent()

```js
element.onGlobalEvent(eventname: string, handler: function): Element
```

event subscription to application wide events (a.k.a. "global events"):

parameters:  
- *eventname*, string, arbitrary event name, may contain namespace part: `"click.myns"`;
- *handler*, function,
  * the handler is called with `this` set to the element;
returns
- element itself allowing to chain `onGlobalEvent` calls.

:::tip
The element gets unsubscribed automatically when it gets disconnected from the DOM. 
:::

Global events can be sent or posted by static [Window.send(event)](../Window#Window-send) and [Window.post(event)](../Window#Window-post) and are delivered to all subscribers in all windows of the application.


### offGlobalEvent()

```js
element.offGlobalEvent(eventname: string): Element
```
Unsubscribe event handler by event name (like `"click"`) or by namespace (like `".myns"`).

```js
element.offGlobalEvent(handler: function): Element
```
Unsubscribe event handler by its reference.

```js
element.offGlobalEvent(): Element
```
Unsubscribe all global event handlers from the element.

---

### timer()

```js
element.timer(milliseconds, callback: function)
```
  
Starts timer on element. If the element already has timer with that callback it first gets removed and new timer started instead. This allows to implement effective throttling. If the *callback* function returns `true` value then the timer will keep ticking (like interval timer). The callback is called with `this` set to the element.

### post()

```js
element.post(function [, avoidDuplicates: true | false])
```
Posts the function for later execution. The functions will be executed in the next event loop iteration.

`element.post(function)` conceptually is equivalent to `setTimeout(function,0)` but with two differences:  
1. The function will be called with `this` set to the element;
2. If _avoidDuplicates_ is _true_ (default value) `element.post` checks input queue before sending and if input queue already contains that element/function pair the function will be called only once. 

```js
element.post(event [, avoidDuplicates: true | false] )
```

Posts the instance of [Event](../Event) to the event queue.  `element.post(event)` is an equivalent to [postEvent()](#postEvent).

---

### clear()

```js
element.clear()
```

Removes content of the element - makes it empty.

### unwrapElement()

```js
element.unwrapElement()
```

Removes the element itself and moves its content into its place in the DOM. So after calling `div.unwrapElement()` here:
```html
<body>
  <div>Hello <b>world</b></div> 
</body>
```
it will become
```html
<body>
  Hello <b>world</b>
</body>
```

### wrapNodes()

```js
element.wrapNodes(start:Node,end:Node,wrap:Element)
```

Wraps range of nodes from _start_ to _end_ into _wrap_ element - opposite acction to `unwrapElement()`.

---

### checkCommand()
### executeCommand()

```js
element.checkCommand(command [, params]): flags;
element.executeCommand(command [, params]): flags
```
Support of editable input elements: `<htmlarea>` (WYSIWYG editor), `<plaintext>` (multiline text editor), `<textarea>` and `<input|text>`. 

parameters:
- _command_, string, name of editing operation;
- _params_, optional parameters of the operation;  
returns:
- integer, ORed flags of command availability:
  + `0` - command is supported at current state and caret position;
  + `0x01` - command was applied at current state and caret position;
  + `0x02` - command is disabled, not supported at current state and caret position;

Examples:
```js
if(htmlarea.checkCommand("edit:paste") == 0)
  // a) clipboard contains pasteable content and 
  // b) it can be pasted at current caret position 
```

```js
htmlarea.execCommand("edit:insert-html", html);
```
Insert the _html_ at current caret position. The insert operation is undoable by the user.

TBD...

---

### xcall()

```js
element.xcall(name:string [, arg0, ..., argN]): any
```

Interaction with native behaviors attached to the element. 

`element.xcall("foo")` will end up in [`handle_scripting_call()`](https://gitlab.com/sciter-engine/sciter-js-sdk/-/blob/main/include/sciter-x-behavior.h#L761) of native behavior attached to the element.

---

### paintBackground {#paintXXXX}
### paintContent
### paintForeground
### paintOutline

```js
element.paintBackground = function(graphics) {...} 
element.paintContent = function(graphics) {...}
element.paintForeground = function(graphics) {...}
element.paintOutline = function(graphics) {...}
```

Immediate mode drawing support. 

Functions assigned to these "port" properties will be called when the element is rendered on screen so they can draw anything on top (or below) of default HTML/CSS rendering. These functions receive current [Graphics](../../Graphics) object that is used to paint the rest of the DOM.

```js
element.requestPaint();
```

Invalidates element painting area - schedules re-paint of the element. This will trigger `element.paintXXXX` later calls (if any). On Windows this will end up in [InvalidateRect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-invalidaterect) call.

### flushPaint()

```js
element.flushPaint();
```

Forces immediate paint of element's window. Synchronous, blocking function - it will return after window surface will be updated.

:::caution
Use this method with care and only when you really need it, e.g. when you need to update screen before blocking operation:
:::
Example: 
```js
  progressEl.value = progress;
  progressEl.flushPaint();
  progress = someBlockingOperation();
```

---

### popup()

```js
element.popup(popup:Element | JSX, params : Object )
```

Shows the _popup_ element or VNode (JSX) in out-of-canvas popup window on desktop. Params is an object that may have following fields:

+ _anchorAt_ - 1..9, reference point on anchor border box (see keyboard NUMPAD for the meaning);
+ _popupAt_ - 1..9, reference point on popup's _margin_ box; 
+ _x_, _y_ - optional, explicit window coordinates of _popupAt_ point.
+ _animationType_ - optional, one of "blend" | "inflate" | "slide" | "roll" - type of window appearance animation;
+ _animationAxis_ - optional, one of "horizontal" | "vertical" ;
+ _animationHeading_ - optional, one of "start-to-end" | "end-to-start";
+ _animationDuration_ - [duration](../../JS/units/Duration) of the animation;

Engine will try to replace popup (element inside window) so _popupAt_ position is at _anchorAt_ on screen.

:::tip
popup positioning can be defined in CSS by [popup-position](../../CSS/properties#popupposition). In this case _params_ can be ommited.
::: 

:::tip
popup animation can be defined in CSS by [popup-animation](../../CSS/properties#popupanimation). 
::: 


### takeOff()

```js
element.takeOff(params:object)
element.takeOff()
```

Make the element "airborn" - to be replaced outside of host window, *params* are:

- `params.x`,`params.y` - numeric, element coordinates, *screen* pixels - new position of DOM element;
- `params.width`,`params.height`  - optional, numeric, new dimensions in *screen* pixels;
- `relativeTo` - string, defines meaning of *x* and *y*, one of:   "screen","document","window","parent" or "self"
- `window` - string, defines type of window that will host the element, one of: 
  + "attached" - attached window, will move in sync with the host window; 
  + "detached" - detached window, position will be independent from the host window;
  + "popup" - same as "detached" window, put also will be placed as topmost - on top of other windows on desktop.

takeOff() call without parameters lands the element back - brings it to its normal position it was before it was taken off. 

---

### replaceContent()

```js
element.replaceContent(newContent:JSX[,params:object]) : Promise | undefined;
```

Changes content of the element with various animation effects.

_params_ here is an object that may contain following fields:

  * `params.duration` - integer, milliseconds - duration of the animation, optional, 200ms if not provided;
  * `params.ease` - string, name of ease function, optional, "linear" is used by default;
  
    #### animate ease functions: {#animate-ease}
    
    * "linear",
    * "ease","ease-in","ease-in-out","ease-out",
    * "quad-in","quad-out","quad-in-out",
    * "cubic-in","cubic-out","cubic-in-out",
    * "quart-in","quart-out","quart-in-out",
    * "quint-in","quint-out","quint-in-out",
    * "sine-in","sine-out","sine-in-out",
    * "expo-in","expo-out","expo-in-out",
    * "circ-in","circ-out","circ-in-out",
    * "elastic-in","elastic-out","elastic-in-out",
    * "back-in","back-out","back-in-out",
    * "x-back-in","x-back-out","x-back-in-out",
    * "xx-back-in","xx-back-out","xx-back-in-out",
    * "bounce-in","bounce-out","bounce-in-out";

  * `params.effect` - string, name of transition effect method, optional, "blend" by default, one of: 
    * "blend",
    * "blend-atop",
    * "slide-top",
    * "slide-bottom",
    * "slide-left",
    * "slide-right",
    * "slide-over-top",
    * "slide-over-bottom",
    * "slide-over-left",
    * "slide-over-right",
    * "remove-top",
    * "remove-bottom",
    * "remove-left",
    * "remove-right",
    * "scroll-top",
    * "scroll-bottom",
    * "scroll-left",
    * "scroll-right"

If _params_ object is ommited then the function does instant replacement, equivalent of `element.patch(JSX,true/*only-children*/)`.

:::tip
If _params_ object is provided then the function returns `await`'able promise that gets resolved at the end of animation. 
:::

### morphContent()

```js
element.morphContent(step:function,params:object)
```

The method offers "manual" animation support. The _step_ function has following signature 
`function step(progress:0.0 ... 1.0): true | false`

Sciter will call step function with animation frame rate passing current progress value. If the function returns *false* animation stops.

*params* may contain following fields:

+ `params.duration` - integer, optional, milliseconds - duration of the animation;
+ `params.ease` - string, optional, name of ease function, see [params.ease](#animate-ease) above. This parameter determines curvature of *progress* values. 

---

### append()

```js
element.append( JSX )
```
appends element defined by JSX expression (vnode) as the last child:
  
```js
  list.append(<li>yet another item</li>);
```

### prepend()

```js
element.prepend( JSX )
```
insert the element as the first child

### content()

```js
element.content(JSX)
```
replaces element content by the JSX expression (VNode):

```js
  div.content(<>Per aspera ad <b>astra</b>!</>);
```

### patch()

```js
element.patch( JSX [, onlyChildren:true] )
```

patches content of the element by JSX (vnode) using rules of React[or]. If second parameter is provided and is _true_ the function patches only children but not element itself.

This is a core function of native implementation of React[or]. 

### componentUpdate()

```js
element.componentUpdate( [obj] )
```
patces properties and enqueues rendering if _obj_ properties are different, does roughly the following:  

```js
if(Object.assignIf(element,obj))    // 1. merge properties and if they are different
  element.post( (element) => {     // 2. enqueue update
    let vnode = element.render();  // 3. calls .render() that must return vnode (JSX expression)
    element.patch(vnode);          // 4. reconciliation / patching
  });
```
If _obj_ is ommited then the method performs uncoditional update: 
```js
 this.patch(this.render())
``` 

### rangeFromPoint()

```js
element.rangeFromPoint(x,y) : Range | null
```

Returns collapsed [range](../Node/Range) (caret position) at point x/y. x/a are local coordinates - relative to origin of element's inner box.   

### toString()

```js
element.toString() : string
```

Returns short string representation of the element. Used mostly for debug purposes.

### box()

```js
element.box(boxType[,relativeTo[,asPpx]]) : Rect
```

parameters:

- _boxType_ , string, defines particular metric of the element:

  * "inner" - inner box of the element in terms of CSS box model;
  * "border" - border box of the element;
  * "padding" - padding box of the element;
  * "margin" - margin box of the element;
  * "client" - client box of the element - scrollable clip area of the element, usually that is padding box minus scrollbars;
  * "content" - content outline of the element. For scrollable elements that is size of scrollable content;
  * "caret" - caret postion (if any);
  * "icon" - position of *foreground* image (CSS) on the element;
  * "scroll" - projection of *client* rect on content box of the element:
    ![scroll schema](images/scroll-box.png) 

- _relativeTo_, string. defines offset of x/y values of returned box, one of:

  * *element* - reference to other element, coordinates are relative to the _element_;
  * "screen" - relative to screen - absolute coordinates of the element on screen (desktop);
  * "window" - relative to client area of the window;
  * "document" - relative to root element - document;
  * "parent" - relative to DOM parent of the element;
  * "container" - relative to layout container - for position'ed elements this tells position relative to nearest positioned container;
  * "self" - default, relative to the element itself, "inner" x/y are 0 in this case;

- _asPpx_, boolean, if defined and is _true_ tells the function to return coordinates in screen pixels. By default the function returns logical CSS pixels a.k.a. DIPs - logical units, 1/96 of inch.

returns:
- [Graphics.Rect](../../Graphics/Rect) object. 

### create()

Static, class method, constructor of Element instances:
```js
Element.create(JSX | tag:string) : Element
```
returns an element constructed either from JSX expression (vnode) or by tag name. In later case it behaves exactly as `document.createElement(tag)`.
